-----

The is a quick setup using webpack to watch your files and to compile your code from ES5 to ES6.

## Instructions
* Clone this repo and run `npm install`.
* Before developing run `npm start` which will watch the files and transpile them from ES6 to ES5.
* Write your ES6 code in any js file in the `src` folder which will then automatically compile your code into ES5 and write the compiled code into `build/index.js`
